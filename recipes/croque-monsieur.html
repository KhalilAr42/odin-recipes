    <h2 class="center-text">Description</h2>

    <p class="center-text">
        Croque Monsieur is a delicious French ham and cheese sandwich made with gruyere, parmesan, ham and a simple béchamel sauce, toasted in the oven.
    </p>


    <h2 class="center-text">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Bechamel sauce</li>
        <li>Ham – Preferably smoked (who doesn’t love smoked ham?), but any ham is good here.</li>
        <li>Gruyere and Swiss cheese – The main cheeses! Gruyere is an Alpine cheese from Switzerland. It has a pleasantly sweet and nutty flavour,</li>
        <li>Parmesan – Alpine cheeses are relatively mild, so parmesan boosts the savoury oomph and saltiness to just where we want it</li>
        <li>Butter – For pan-searing our Croque Monsieur in buttery goodness before it’s finished in the oven!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="center-text">Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Spread béchamel on bread. Lay all of your bread slices on the counter and spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on each slice.</li>
        <li>Add ham and cheese. Add one layer of ham and a sprinkle of cheese to half of the bread slices. </li>
        <li>Top with bread.  Top the ham and cheese with another slice of bread, making sure to leave the béchamel facing up.</li>
        <li>Finishing touches.  Sprinkle the top layer of bread with more parmesan and gruyere.</li>
        <li>Bake. until bread is toasted and cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
