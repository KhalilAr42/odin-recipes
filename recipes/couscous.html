    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Couscous – sometimes called kusksi or kseksu – is a traditional North African dish of small steamed granules
        of rolled semolina that is often served with a stew spooned on top.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked
        in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 kg couscous - (not instant; I prefer medium caliber)</li>
        <li>55 ml olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 kg lamb, beef, or goat meat, large pieces on the bone - (or 1 large whole chicken)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 fresh tomatoes, peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>100 g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight</li>
        <li>1 small head of cabbage, cut in half or quartered</li>
        <li>3 or 4 medium turnips, peeled and cut in half</li>
        <li>8 to 10 carrots, peeled - (cut in half lengthwise if large)</li>
        <li>4 or 5 small zucchini, ends trimmed - (or 8-ball round, cut in half)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Brown the meat or chicken with the oil, onion, tomatoes and spices in the base of a couscoussier over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked, drained chickpeas along with the parsley/cilantro bouquet and about 3 quarts (or liters) of water. </li>
        <li>Drizzle 1/4 cup of oil over the couscous. Toss and roll the couscous around between your hands for a minute to distribute the oil evenly and break up any balls or clumps. </li>
        <li>Transfer the couscous to a lightly oiled steamer basket, taking care not to compress the grains in the process</li>
        <li>Turn the couscous back into your gsaa or bowl. Allow it to cool briefly, then work in 1 cup of water, using the same tossing and turning as you did before.</li>
        <li>Add the salt in the same manner, then add in another 1 cup of water.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage, onions, tomatoes (and fava beans, if using) to the couscous pot, then place the couscous basket on the couscoussier.</li>
        <li>Turn the steamed couscous out into your gssaa or bowl. </li>
        <li>Add the remaining vegetables to the pot--the squash or pumpkin, the zucchini and the sweet potatoes if using.</li>
        <li>Place the couscous basket back on the pot and cook until steam begins to emerge from the couscous.</li>
    </ol>
